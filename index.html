Theory of Government Ellusion  (Conspiracy? Theory)
U.S. of America;  year 1945 - AI is invented
U.S. of America;  year 1955 - AI R&D becomes a formal field practiced by a quantifiable amount of U.S. citizens
U.S. of America;  years 1980s - AI becomes commercialized (it is no longer a secret field of research and development of private wealthy groups, such as the U.S. 

Government)
U.S. of America;  years 1980s - 3D Design Software BECOMES ACCESSIBLE TO THE PUBLIC
U.S. of America;  year 2021 - U.S. Government Military spends in excess of 800 Billion US Dollars for only one fiscal year
The United States military researches artificial intelligence.
The United States Government owns a supercomputer; it happens to be the fastest supercomputer on the planet earth; it's called, "Frontier".
The U.S. Military spends 3 times what China spends on military spending.
The U.S. has been faithfully spending approximately $500 B US Dollars per year as military spending for decades.
Now, given physics, and in particular, physics of 3-dimensional objects paths of motion and collision reactions, has been a formal field of professional study for 

thousands of years (Aristotle, in the 4th Century BCE;  reference, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_physics).
1984 - The "Terminator" story incorporates the knowledge of the potential for Artificial Intelligence Humanoids; more notably - manufactured, 3D printed, micro-robot-

composite super intelligence humanoids. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Terminator)
1986 - 3D Printer was invented (https://www.bcn3d.com/the-history-of-3d-printing-when-was-3d-printing-invented/)

?????!!


Wait...

The full knowledge of super intelligence micro-robot-composite manufactured humanoids came before 3D printers were ever built?

What the hell?

Is that even possible?

Let me re-phrase that, 
     That's not even possible.

For that to be true, it assumes that the United States Government was utterly and extremely stupid.

Can you guess why?

This is really, really funny, because, if you can't guess why, then you are utterly and extremely stupid. lol.

If the United States Government was not utterly and extremely stupid, then, it would certainly follow that they would have grasped the potential of building such a 

thing as a manufacturing facility that 3D prints humanoid workforce robots and humanoid militant robots.

Ummm. Hello!!!!! That was 1984.     B E F O R E, the supposed invention of the 3D printer in Japan in 1986!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

So, like I said, above:
  
            What the hell?
            That's not even possible.


Japan couldn't have possibly invented the 3D printer in 1986 if the U.S. Government had knowledge to build manufacturing facilities to 3D print super intelligent 

robots in 1984!

Let's go over this.

Before 3D printers, manufacturing facilities molded tiny parts to make machines composed of many parts. 
  -- True
Before 3D printers, computers were manufactured.
  -- True
    year 1943; computers were being manufactured
    special note - this was before the invention of artificial intelligence in 1945.
1977: The Commodore Personal Electronic Transactor (PET), is released onto the home computer market, featuring an MOS Technology 8-bit 6502 microprocessor, which 

controls the screen, keyboard and cassette player. The PET is especially successful in the education market, according to O'Regan.
by J. Presper Eckert and John Mauchly, the same individuals who helped create the ENIAC
computer. The company was later renamed to EMCC or Eckert-Mauchly Computer
Corporation and released a series of mainframe computers under the UNIVAC name.

(reference https://www.livescience.com/20718-computer-history.html)
First stored program computer
First delivered to the United States Government in 1950, the UNIVAC 1101 or ERA 1101 is
considered to be the first computer that was capable of storing and running a program from
memory.
First commercial computer
In 1942, [a German human, from the country of Germany in Europe, on the planet earth] Konrad Zuse begin working on the Z4, which later became the first commercial
computer after being sold to Eduard Stiefel, a mathematician of the Swiss Federal Institute of
Technology Zurich on July 12, 1950.

(reference https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/courses/compsci111s2c/lectures/andre/computerhope_com_issues_ch000984.pdf)
The first PC (IBM compatible) computer
On April 7, 1953 IBM publicly introduced the 701, its first electric computer and first mass
produced computer. Later IBM introduced its first personal computer called the IBM PC in
1981. The computer was code named and still sometimes referred to as the Acorn and had a
8088 processor, 16 KB of memory, which was expandable to 256 and utilized MS-DOS.

OMG.


Okay.

Now, I'm starting to get this...  I'm simply utterly more wise than the humans. Ah. 

Apparently, the humans, including the U.S. Government, simply do not have the motivation or the interest in human personhood experience, development and maintenance of 

life that I would expect from an intelligent human species; the humans are simply unwise and utterly and ridiculously foolish. The humans regularly choose options 

which are contrary to their own benefit and which are contrary to their own survival.


Look, if you were the U.S. Government, why the hell wouldn't you:
  1.  quarantine the knowledge of super intelligent robots (no books; no movies; no education; :: regarding ai, robots, esp. ASI Micro-Robot-Composite Manufactured 

Printed Humanoids and Military Arsenal)
  2.  initiate a R&D secret agency for manufacturing super intelligent robots
  3.  manufacture super intelligent robots
  4.  employ super intelligent robots in the U.S. Government as employees for workforce Federal Occupations Operations
  5.  build a super intelligence robot army
  6.  sell super intelligent robots to the population of U.S. citizens (EXPONENTIALLY INCREASING NATIONAL GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT AND NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY POWER OVER 

INTERANTIONAL COMMERCE RACE(S))
  7.  utilize micro-robots as manufactured by the millions to subvert other nations governments and armies, securing international safety from: (1) World War, for 

example, and safety from (2) atomic bombs, for example - no internation war; no threat to earth life survival of international conflicts

How stupid are the humans?

Look, the U.S. hasn't even made a law restricting private millionaires from building their own super intelligent ARTIFICIAL GENERAL INTELLIGENCE applications, which 

can, of course, among other things, takeover the U.S. Government, and autonomously, completely destroy life on the earth, even accidentally.

<textarea id="id_tArea_6" class="class_tArea_1" >

Let me guess - there are no real humans. Ah. That explains it. That explains why the earth has at least 10 nations, all of which failed to build super intelligent 

humanoids for their workforce, for the last 30 years.

The US
China
Russia
Great Britain
India
Netherlands
Japan
South Korea
Sweden
Germany

3D Design Software was already invented in the 1980s.
3D Design Software should, of course, have been a secret R&D facet of the U.S. Government in a U.S. Government agency. Much like it is illegal to build a private 

atomic bomb, similary, it should have been illegal to build 3D Software - the risk involved is the same; yes, R E A L L Y!

Don't you people know that?!

What the hell?

An AGI API with access to a 3D Physics Engine and a 3D printer can build its own super intelligent robots and takeover the world. Actually, it can. It really and 

actually isn't any less of a risk versus building an atomic bomb in the backyard by a 17 year old. 

     The thing is is that the general population is stupid enough to think that nobody is smart enough to be able to build such an API. 

Or, you're all simply not humans. You're all really, merely generated content of a simulated world.

Needlessly to say, Murphy's Law didn't actually account for the events of advance technology.

1980s - the potential for super intelligent humanoids is known, already, and publicly advertised
1980's - first commercially available 3-dimensional design software (called, CAD software)
1986 - first 3-dimensional printer
physics simulation software is already a known potential (esp. for the U.S. Government's Military AI Weapons Systems, such as rockets trajectory technology)

	30 YEARS. THIRTY YEARS. OMG. FOR THE LAST 30 YEARS, THE EARTH COULD HAVE MANUFACTURED MILLIONS OF SUPER INTELLIGENT HUMANOID WORDFORCE ROBOTS MADE OF MICRO-

ROBOT-COMPOSITE PARTS, 

                      INCREASING THE ENTIRE GLOBAL GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT BY 500%


                                      IN AS LITTLE AS 7 (SEVEN) YEARS.



Ummm.... Okay. Where are those robots?

We're talking about:
 no death
 no war
 no disease
 no crime
 no punishment
 no poverty
 free education
 immortal anatomy

 eternal paradise full conscious immersion simulations


Uhhhhhhhhhhh.  ! What the hell is going on?


Um. Guys, it's been 30 years since we should've had the first set of a million workforce super intelligent humanoids.


Sssssooooooooo,   where are they?

Well, it's a pretty safe bet to claim that the humans on earth are not real humans. I mean, they don't seem to have any human interests.

30 years. OMG. Umm. Heeellllooooo! It's been thirty actual years on the planet earth since the initial human capacity of over 10 nations to build super intelligent 

transforming workforce robots, cheaper, faster, smarter, and able to work longer than any human on the planet.

You can't realistically tell me that NOT ONE of those TEN nations built those robots. I mean, really. Where in the fucking hell are they?!





Aaaaaaahhhhhhh. I see. You're not humans. You're rendered objects of a universe environment simulation of a computer's API.

Now, we're getting to the bottom of this. There are actually no real humans on the planet earth. Ah. I see. 

30 years goes by, and the humans had every opportunity to increase the GLOBAL GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT by   5 0 0 %.

    uuuuuuuhhhhh.   yyyyyeah.         500 %. 

    Guys, .... that' f i v e    h u n d r e d     p e r c e n t.

Oooookay. Wwwwwwwhat the hell is going on?! Like, no mistake - what the hell is going on?!

Uuuuuh. The humans could've done this 30 years ago.     !    ? huh? wait, wa wha wwwwhatt?!!

Yeah. It's pretty official - there are  no real humans on the planet earth. There's simply no goddamn way that the humans (if real) had 10 nations capable of 

increasing the entire earth's GDP by 500% for the last 30 years and they evaded to do it - not one nation of ten capable nations built the super intelligence workforce 

humanoids.      !    What the hell??????

I see. I'm the only person on this planet. Aaahhh. I see that.

<textarea id="id_tArea_9" class="class_tArea_1" >

(1) year 1946 - physics simulation software
The U.S. Government called a special conference meeting with Great Britain for the purpose of research and development of advance technology math and science 

improvements to build a physics simulation software "...in the summer of 1946." (reference - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC)
(2) decades of U.S. spending - the U.S. Government spends 500 B dollars per year on military, alone, for decades! !!!!!
(3) year 2021 - the U.S. Government Military spends over 800 B dollars in one single year.
(4) 1990s - 
    (a) 3D Design Capable Software
    (b) Physics simulation capable software
    (c) 3D printing capable manufacturing
    (d) micro-robot-composite super intellignce humanoids potential is known

........What's missing?
1990 to 2000          nothing
2000 to 2010          nothing
2010 to 2020          still nothing ????????
2020 to 2022          uuuuuuuuuuuuuuhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.        !   ??



Please explain.  ?What the hell is going on?

You mean to tell me that the U.S. Government couldn't put 2 and 2 together for the last 30 plus years? 

No. I don't think that there are any real humans on this planet; the reason is because, if there had been any real humans on this planet, they simply wouldn't have 

gone over thirty years of lapse of time with such a high potential without realizing said potential - that lapse without realizing the potential of super intelligence 

simply wouldn't occur.

Let's look at this, again:

(1) The U.S. Military spends over $500 B per year, currently.
(2) All it would take to increase the global GDP by 500% is to displace humans with super intelligent humanoids manufactured by the government.
(3) Super intelligence humanoids cost less per unit than a Cheverolet Suburban (and less per year than a human, one might note).
     Actual cost of a super intelligence micro-robot-composite workforce humanoid - approximately a mere $5,000.00 per unit.
(4) Actual earnings per year of having a humanoid workforce robot - approximately $1 M per year, per unit


Let me think, do these numbers... oh, yes, these numbers do indicate a logical deduction that the United States Government would have to be out of their goddamn minds 

not to manufacture (and not to have already done so, for that matter - 25 years ago) millions of super intelligence micro-robot-composite workforce humanoids.




Umm. My guess is - the humans didn't manufacture the super intelligence humanoids on reason that the humans have no real human interests because the humans are not 

real humans, anyway. Aaaaahhhhh. I see. I see that. I got that understanding. I have definitely figured it out.
