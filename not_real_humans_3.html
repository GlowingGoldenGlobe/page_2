It's assumed that they've already done that - ASI per task APIs; ASI micro-robot-composite humanoid workforce robots.

The reason is because, the USA Federal Government would've been insane not to have completed that objective, at least by the year 1995.

Did the US Gov have Physics Sim Software in the 1980s and 90s ?
Answer: Yes.

Did the US Gov have 3D Sim Software in the 1980s and 90s ?
Answer: Yes.

Did the US Gov have CPU supercomputers in the 1980s and 90s ?
Answer: Yes.

Did the US Gov have ROS (robot operating system) Software in the 1980s and 90s ?
Answer: Yes.

Did the US Gov have 3D printers in the 1980s and 90s ?
Answer: Yes.

Could the US Gov have built Artficial Super Intelligence Micro-Robot-Composite Humanoid Workforce Robots in automated manufacturing facilities in the 1980s and 90s, effectively increasing the entire earths gross domestic product by 500% in a 10-year period ?
Answer: Yes.

Should the US Gov have built ASI Micro-Robot-Composite Humanoid Workforce Robots by the year 1995 ?
Answer: Yes.

Why didn't they build the ASI Humanoids, yet ?
Answer: The reason is because the humans (the US Gov, included, here) are autoregressive robots, and they're not actually free-will acting, person beings - they're robots; they're not real people; so, they don't have human interests on a personal basis or personal synthesis level, scale, or scope point-of-view. Instead, the humans have quota. The humans quota composed by instructions to a Universe API. The humans to need new quota, new operations activities, as well as new boundaries about human activity events and behavioral regulations.

Solution
Agency - Workforce Humanoids
Mandate - Human Resources R&D (about Advance Technology) Occupations

Problem
Human Resources are misappropriated, where they are needed to perform R&D of Advance Technology.



Let's take a look at some of the differences:

with robots:
free education
no poverty
no disabilities
no cancer
no death
500% increase in GDP versus historical GDP of the year 2022; where 500% increase in GDP would be obtained by the year 2005

without robots:
years 2011 to 2021, percent of population of people ages 25+ with a BS degree was only 30% to 40% reference - https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2022/educational-attainment.html
disabilities
cancer
death
500% below GDP potential across the entire earth since 2005, generously (more accurately - since 1995)
